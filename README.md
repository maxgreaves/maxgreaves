- Currently looking for an internship/Co-op opportunity for Summer 2025, with the ability to extend to Fall 2025.
- ðŸ‘€ I love all sports (but particularly Baseball, Hockey, and Spikeball), and I love to learn new things! I do Leetcode in bed before I sleep
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Python and its applications to sports analytics, as well as various courses in CS and optimization.
