- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @maxgreaves, a 2B Computational Mathematics student at the University of Waterloo, Minoring in Computing
- Currently looking for an internship/Co-op opportunity for Fall 2024, with the ability to extend to Winter 2025.
- ðŸ‘€ I love all sports (but particularly Baseball, Hockey, and Spikeball), and I love to learn new things! I do Leetcode in bed before I sleep
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Python and its applications to sports analytics, as well as various courses in CS and optimization.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can email me at mmgreave@uwaterloo.ca, I'm happy to talk about anything!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I know a little about a lot of things, which I have found to be an interesting combination...

Reach out!
